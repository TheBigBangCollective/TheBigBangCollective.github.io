      The Festival Programme began in 2015. At the end of a long day visiting
      CERN, Real World CEO Mike Large was having a beer on the CERN terrace with
      Connie Potter and Chris Thomas from CERN and Roger Jones from Lancaster
      University.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike, overseeing the WOMAD music festivals, felt that the WOMAD UK
      audience would love to hear about some of the science going on at CERN.
    </p>
    <p>
      The locals were not convinced – “why would people in the middle of the
      countryside, faced with a programme of music, books, dance and well-being
      want to listen to talks on science?” – but Mike was confident – his WOMAD
      audience were curious, eager to always learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial concept of the Physics Pavilion evolved into the first World
      of Physics through a collaboration between CERN, WOMAD, and Lancaster
      University.

      That first World of Physics offered a 3 day programme of hands-on
      workshops, talks and shows to over 5000 people over the 3 days. The
      success was phenomenal and continues to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of attendees state on the feedback forms that they never go
      to science events during the year, that the fun, engaging way in which we
      share our science, including having real physicists welcoming them, on
      hand to discuss any topics they wish, changed their feelings about
      science.It wasn’t the hard slog they had known at school, with uninspiring
      teachers. They weren’t made to feel stupid with their questions. They
      revelled in this new found interest and kept coming back each day, and
      still do.. each year.

      As Connie and Chris gave talks on this new form of outreach to the public,
      it became clear from responses from the community that other countries
      were very keen to have their own Science Pavilion and so the Big Bang
      Collective was formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partnerships were formed with collaborating institutes in Slovakia, the
      Czech Republic and Denmark resulting in Science Pavilions at the Pohoda
      Festival in Slovakia, the Colours of Ostrava in the Czech Republic and the
      Roskilde Festival in Denmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2024 we are proud to announce that we will be launching a new Science
      Pavilion at the Smukfest in Denmark and Rototon Sunsplash in Spain.
