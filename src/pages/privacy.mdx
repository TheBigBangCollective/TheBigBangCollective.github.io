_\* We have carried out (and documented) a Legitimate Interests Assessment to ensure our need to process this information is balanced against your privacy rights._

### Special-category personal data  
We may ask you to provide special-category data (e.g. criminal-background checks) **only if required** by the festival’s security or legal obligations.  
- **Scope:** Collected strictly for compliance with venue security protocols or other legal requirements.  
- **Lawful basis:** The exact legal ground (explicit consent, contract performance, or legal obligation) will be confirmed in the request form or accompanying notice before you submit any such information.  
- **Your choice:** You will receive a separate information notice explaining:  
  1. Why the data is needed  
  2. Which legal basis applies  
  3. Who will see it  
  4. How long we will keep it  

## 4. How We Share Your Data  
- **Festival organisers** (accommodation providers, security teams) for assigning rooms and passes.  
- **Funders** and sponsors when reporting on festival participation—only name and affiliation.  
- **Third-party processors**: Google (Email / Forms), and Airtable. See their privacy policies for details.  
- **International transfers**: If a processor stores data outside the EU, we ensure appropriate safeguards (e.g. Standard Contractual Clauses).

## 5. Data Retention  
We retain your basic registration and logistical details for up to two years after the festival ends, unless you request deletion sooner. Special-category data is deleted one year after the event.

## 6. Your Rights  
Under GDPR (and similar laws), you have the right to:  
- Access the personal data we hold about you.  
- Rectify any inaccurate or incomplete data.  
- Erase your data (the “right to be forgotten”)—subject to any legal obligations.  
- Restrict or object to our processing (eg. logistical communications).  
- Data portability (receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format).  
- Withdraw consent at any time (for processing based on consent).  

To exercise any right, please contact info@thebigbangcollective.com or kaj@k-si.com. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g. the Dutch Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens).

## 7. Security Measures  
We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, including:  
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS).  
- Access controls and logging.  
- Regular security reviews.

## 8. Automated Decision-making  
We do not use profiling or automated decision-making in our festival operations. All decisions are made by humans.

## 9. Changes to This Notice  
We may update this notice to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. The “Last updated” date at the top will indicate when it was revised. Significant changes will be highlighted on our homepage.
