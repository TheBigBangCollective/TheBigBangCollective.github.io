The WOMAD Festival, renowned for its celebration of global music and culture, also showcases an engaging World of Physics. This segment of the festival offers a profound dive into the marvels of science, attracting both the curious and the scholarly. This year, the World of Physics is set to captivate attendees with a host of activities including demonstrations on radio telescopes, explorations into artificial intelligence, and tributes to notable figures like Peter Higgs. Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to engage in building their own computer games, making it a haven for interactive and educational experiences within the realm of physics.

This initiative is part of WOMAD's broader effort to integrate cutting-edge science into the festival environment, working in collaboration with prestigious institutions like CERN and the University of Lancaster. The goal is to challenge and expand attendees' understanding through hands-on activities and discussions led by experts in the field. The festival's dynamic approach ensures a stimulating experience that bridges the gap between arts and sciences, reflecting its longstanding commitment to fostering an inclusive and enlightening atmosphere.
