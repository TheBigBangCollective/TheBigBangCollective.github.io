This year marks a significant milestone for the Big Bang Collective as it makes its inaugural appearance at Rototom Sunsplash, held in the scenic town of Benic√†ssim, Spain. Known for its commitment to promoting peace, equality, and sustainability, Rototom is not just a music festival; it's a vibrant cultural gathering that celebrates reggae music and offers a diverse array of activities including workshops, arts, and cultural presentations.

The Big Bang Collective brings its unique mix of scientific talks and workshops to Rototom, enriching the festival's lineup with topics ranging from the impressive legacy of CERN's 70 years of scientific advancement to practical uses of AI in everyday life. Discussions will also explore critical environmental issues such as ocean pollution and space debris. By integrating these elements, the Big Bang Collective enhances the Rototom experience, broadening the cultural and intellectual appeal of the festival and fostering a deeper appreciation of global issues among attendees. This exciting collaboration highlights the festival's expansion into educational realms, making it a truly unique and enriching cultural event in Spain.
