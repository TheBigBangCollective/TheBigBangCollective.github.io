        We had a fantastic time bringing science to WOMAD 2024 with our Festival Programme. Throughout the week, visitors enjoyed hands-on soldering workshops, experimented with sonic levitation, and engaged in discussions about artificial intelligence. We had talks covering all areas of science from space exploration, the physics of the three-body problem—all and a packed session on the future of transport featuring Robert Llewellyn from Fully Charged. 2024 also saw the return of the spectacular nighttime Tesla coil created by Alessandro Cerri of the University of Sussex.
