      Once again co-producer, physicist Martin Rybar from Charles University and the team, have pulled together an incredibly varied programme for the audience of this well-established music festival. 

      With shows, panel discussions, some fun ‘sketch-noting’ for a talk and debate, a conversation with Nobel Prize winner Prof. Morten Meldahl, and a very special interactive 6 m artistic installation on the theme of ‘quantum’ all in the incredible setting of the Svet Techniky science space within the confines of the Ostrava music festival, this is sure to be another huge success.

      Set in a beautiful forest in central Denmark, this will be the second year for the CERN Festival Programme at Smukfest. Last year’s Science Pavilion had a stellar programme welcoming not only a Nobel Prize winner but also the Danish commander of the International Space Station to the stage. And this year’s programme, co-produced by Joergen Beck Hansen from the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen promises to be very exciting with talks on Nuclear power, Quantum computing - what’s it all about and the Science of Addiction .. just for starters!

      A brand new partnership for the CERN Festival Programme this year with the highly regarded Sonorama Ribera festival in Aranda de Duero in the north of Spain. This festival with a big focus on all types of Spanish music welcomes over 100’000 people each year and we are delighted that it is opening its doors to their first ever Science Pavilion. With a fantastic team of co-producers : Mathematician and TV star Eduardo Saenz de Cabezón, physicist and outreach maestro Jesus Puerta Pelayo from Madrid, technician and workshop host Ivan Lopez Paz from Barcelona and Cristina Romero Castillo from Barcelona, this new stage is going to be offering free workshops to make your own solar chargers, and turn a piece of CERN history into your own little LED lamp display, and talks from eminent Spanish personalities on Solar eclipses and Astrobiology, this is one festival you don’t want to miss!

      We return to Spain, to the seaside town of Benicassim and this lively, friendly reggae music festival now in its 30th year for a second year of the Discovery Lab! With the same co-producers as for Sonorama, the programme running over a full week will have shows, workshops, talks on topics such as the upcoming solar eclipse, cybersecurity and YouTube science stars, there will be something for everybody under the daily sunshine of Rototom!
